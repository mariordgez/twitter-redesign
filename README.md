# RoR-Twitter-Redesign Capstone Project

This project was intended to put my knowledge of Ruby on Rails module into practice through the Twitter-Redesign app that allows user to login, view homepage/tweets, suggestion on who to follow, access their user profile and those of others, and creating tweets.

I used Bulma to style this project and it was a really fun experience to do so. The design I have emulated is by Design idea by [Gregoire Vella on Behance](https://www.behance.net/gregoirevella).
